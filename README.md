Hi ðŸ‘‹,

I have a background in Geospatial Information Science (GIS) and love to solve spatial challenges using my knowledge of spatial data, architecture and the right tools for the job. I have worked for over 15 years at Ordnance Survey, Great Britain's National Mapping Agency, where I provide customers with all levels of expertise and consultancy to maximise their return on investment when using our Open and Premium data. Over the years I have worked on some amazing projects like the Olympics 2012, launched an AWARD winning product OS Open Zoomstack and talked at a number of global conferences.
